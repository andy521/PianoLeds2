; Not using the Library Dependency Finder of PlatformIO to find all dependencies, because for the other targets (pc / test),
; scons is used with SConscripts which handle this differently. Moreover, the way LDF puts dependencies on the compiler's
; include search path mismatches with the way the different sources use #include now.
; Let PlatformIO run this special SConscript to build and use the dependencies in a way which matches with the other targets.
; 
; NOTE: For this to work, the environment variable SCONSFLAGS needs to be set and contain (at least):
; "--site-dir [your_absolute_path_to]/mlc2/Source/site_scons"
